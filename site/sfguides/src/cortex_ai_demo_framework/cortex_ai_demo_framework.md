# Cortex AI Demo Framework
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview
Duration: 5

Demo development is crucial for businesses to showcase their AI capabilities and win new customers. Through rapid prototyping and professional presentation tools, businesses can transform weeks of development into minutes of setup, dramatically accelerating sales cycles and proof-of-concept delivery.

In this Quickstart, we will build a comprehensive demo development platform called "Cortex AI Demo Framework". This demonstrates how to use Snowflake Cortex AI functions to create synthetic data, build interactive analytics, deploy search capabilities, and generate complete demonstration environments.

This Quickstart showcases the complete Cortex AI Demo Framework with:
- **5-application integrated demo platform** with Synthetic Data Generator, Structured Tables, SQL to YAML Converter, Snow Demo, and Snow Viz
- **AI-powered data generation** using all Cortex functions

## Setup Snowflake Environment  
Duration: 5

In this step, you'll create the Snowflake database objects and prepare for framework deployment.

### Step 1: Create Database Objects

> aside positive
> 
> Starting in September 2025, Snowflake is gradually upgrading accounts from Worksheets to [Workspaces](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/workspaces). Workspaces will become the default SQL editor. Follow the instructions below that match your interface.

**If you have Workspaces:**
1. In Snowsight, click `Projects`, then `Workspaces` in the left navigation
2. Click `+ Add new` to create a new Workspace
3. Click `SQL File` to create a new SQL file
4. Copy the setup script from [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-cortex-demo-developer-framework/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) and paste it into your SQL file, then run it

**If you have Worksheets:**
1. In Snowsight, click `Projects`, then `Worksheets` in the left navigation
2. Click `+` in the top-right corner to open a new Worksheet
3. Copy the setup script from [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-cortex-demo-developer-framework/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) and paste it into your worksheet, then run it

The setup script creates:
- **Database**: `CORTEX_FRAMEWORK_DB` with `BRONZE_LAYER`, `SILVER_LAYER`, `APPS`, and `CONFIGS` schemas
- **Role**: `CORTEX_FRAMEWORK_DATA_SCIENTIST` with all necessary permissions  
- **Warehouse**: `CORTEX_FRAMEWORK_WH` for compute resources
- **Stages**: `FRAMEWORK_DATA_STAGE`, `SEMANTIC_MODELS`, and `DEMO_CONFIGS` for file uploads
- **File Formats**: `CSV_FORMAT`, `YAML_FORMAT`, and `JSON_FORMAT` for data processing
- **AI Access**: `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER` role for Cortex functions

### Step 2: Download Required Framework Files

Download these framework files from the GitHub repository:

| File | Purpose | Download Link |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Synthetic Data Generator** | AI-powered synthetic data creation | [01_ai_framework_synthetic_data_generator.py](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-cortex-ai-demo-framework/blob/main/scripts/01_ai_framework_synthetic_data_generator.py) |

| **Environment File** | Conda environment configuration for latest Streamlit | [environment.yml](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-cortex-ai-demo-framework/blob/main/scripts/environment.yml) |
| **Notebook** | Setup notebook for framework deployment | [cortex_ai_demo_framework_setup.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-cortex-ai-demo-framework/blob/main/notebooks/cortex_ai_demo_framework_setup.ipynb) |

### Step 3: Upload Framework Files to Single Stage

1. In Snowsight, change your role to `cortex_ai_demo_data_scientist`

2. Navigate to `Catalog` â†’ `Database Explorer` â†’ `AI_FRAMEWORK_DB` â†’ `APPS` â†’ `Stages`

**Upload all framework files to the single `AI_FRAMEWORK_APPS` stage:**

3. Click on `AI_FRAMEWORK_APPS` stage, then click `Enable Directory Table` and upload all 6 files:
   - `01_ai_framework_synthetic_data_generator.py`
   - `02_ai_framework_structured_tables.py`
   - `03_ai_framework_sql_to_yaml_converter.py`
   - `04_ai_framework_snow_demo.py`
   - `05_ai_framework_snow_viz.py`
   - `environment.yml`

### Step 4: Import the Framework Setup Notebook

1. **Import into Snowflake**:
   - Navigate to `Projects` â†’ `Notebooks` in Snowsight
   - Click the down arrow next to `+ Notebook` and select `Import .ipynb file`
