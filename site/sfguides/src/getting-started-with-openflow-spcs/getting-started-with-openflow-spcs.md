> **TIP:** Download the SQL scripts to run all commands at once, or use the notebooks for connector-specific setup after completing the basic infrastructure.

### How to Use SQL Scripts in Snowsight

If you downloaded the SQL scripts from the companion repository, here's how to import and execute them in Snowsight:

**Using Projects (Recommended):**

1. **Navigate to Projects**: In Snowsight, go to **Projects** → **Worksheets** (left sidebar)
2. **Create or Open Project**: Click **"+ Project"** to create a new project, or open an existing one
3. **Add SQL File**: Click **"..."** (more options) → **"Import SQL file"**
4. **Select Downloaded Script**: Choose the `.sql` file you downloaded (e.g., `quickstart_setup_core.sql`)
5. **Execute Commands**:
   - **Run All**: Click the **▶ Run All** button to execute the entire script
   - **Step-by-Step**: Select individual SQL statements and click **▶ Run** for granular control

> aside positive
> **NOTE:** The SQL scripts include detailed comments explaining each step. You can also copy-paste commands directly from this guide into a worksheet if you prefer.

### Create Openflow Admin Role

The `OPENFLOW_ADMIN` role is the primary administrative role for managing Openflow deployments.

Log into [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#) and open a SQL worksheet.

> aside positive
> **IMPORTANT:**
>
> - If you use different names for objects created in this section, be sure to update scripts and configurations in the following sections accordingly.
>
> - For each SQL script block below, select all the statements in the block and execute them top to bottom.

Run the following SQL commands to create the Openflow admin role:

```sql
-- Create the Openflow admin role (requires ACCOUNTADMIN or equivalent privileges)
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS OPENFLOW_ADMIN;

-- Grant necessary privileges
GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;
GRANT CREATE COMPUTE POOL ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;
GRANT CREATE INTEGRATION ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;
GRANT BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;

-- Grant role to current user and ACCOUNTADMIN
GRANT ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN TO USER IDENTIFIER(CURRENT_USER());
```

This creates the admin role and grants it the necessary permissions to create and manage Openflow deployments.

### Enable BCR Bundle 2025_06 for Integration-level Network Policy

> aside negative
> **CHECK FIRST:** This step is **only required** if you plan to use Database CDC, SaaS, Streaming, or Slack connectors. If you're unsure which connectors you'll use, check the bundle status first. You can always enable it later if needed.

**Step 1: Check if BCR Bundle 2025_06 is already enabled**

```sql
-- Check the bundle status
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CALL SYSTEM$BEHAVIOR_CHANGE_BUNDLE_STATUS('2025_06');
```

**Step 2: Enable the bundle if status shows `DISABLED`**

If the result shows `DISABLED`, enable the bundle:

```sql
-- Enable BCR Bundle 2025_06
CALL SYSTEM$ENABLE_BEHAVIOR_CHANGE_BUNDLE('2025_06');
```

> aside positive
> **WHY THIS IS NEEDED:**
>
> BCR Bundle 2025_06 enables integration-level network policies required for Database CDC, SaaS, Streaming, and Slack connectors to connect to Snowpipe Streaming. For more details, see [Enable BCR Bundle documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/setup-openflow-spcs-sf#enable-bcr-bundle-2025-06-for-integration-level-network-policy).

   SHOW INTEGRATIONS LIKE 'openflow_%';
   DESC INTEGRATION your_integration_name;
   ```

2. **Check Network Rules**:

   ```sql
   -- Verify all required hostnames are in network rules
   DESC NETWORK RULE your_network_rule;
   ```

3. **Test Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure the external service endpoint is correct
   - Verify firewall rules allow traffic from Snowflake IP ranges
   - Check service credentials are valid

4. **Review Integration Grants**:

   ```sql
   -- Verify runtime role has access
   SHOW GRANTS ON INTEGRATION your_integration_name;
   ```

### Permission Errors

**Issue**: "Insufficient privileges" errors when creating resources

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify Current Role**:

   ```sql
   -- Check which role you're using
   SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
   
   -- Switch to appropriate role
   USE ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;
   -- or
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
   ```

2. **Check Role Hierarchy**:

   ```sql
   -- Verify role grants
   SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;
   SHOW GRANTS TO USER your_username;
   ```

2. **Grant Missing Privileges**:

   ```sql
   -- Example: Grant database creation if missing
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
   GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE OPENFLOW_ADMIN;
